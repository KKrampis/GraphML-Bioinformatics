### Graph Theory and Network analysis in Bioinformatics

* In this lecture we will discuss basic Graph and Network Theory concepts and data structures
* Graphs or otherwise networks are one of the most common ways to represent bioinformatics data 
  * Interaction between genes and proteins (genetic regulation) can be represented as graphs
  * Protein structures can also be respensented as graphs denoting the chemical connections between atoms
  * Beyond molecular biology, interacting species for example can be represented as graphs in ecology

Some of the information we cover today can also be found in this [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_network) 
and this [online course](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/network-analysis-of-protein-interaction-data-an-introduction/network-analysis-in-biology/)

### What is a Graph

* A mathematical structure capturing binary relationships between objects called *nodes* or *vertices*
* The binary relationships are represented by links or *edges* between the *vertices*
* The *edges* can be of a specific type : *directed or undirected, weighted or not*
* Both *nodes* and *edges* can have attributes attached to them

### An example of a biological graph is shown in the image below (credit [Hennah, Porteus](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004906) CC BY 2.5 Licence)

The different shapes of the nodes represent different attributes, the edges here are unweighted

### Example graphs in bioinformatics : Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks

* Protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) represent the physical relationship among proteins present in a cell
* Proteins are nodes, and their interactions are undirected edges
* Proteinâ€“protein interactions are essential to the cellular processes and well studied networks in biology
* Proteins with high degrees of connectedness (nodes with many links) are more likely to be essential for survival of the cell
* Source of this information and additional reading at this [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_network)

### Let's create a graph in Python

*On Google Collab, run first "!pip install matplotlib"  and "!pip install networkx" (without the quotes)*

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_node(1)
G.add_nodes_from([2, 3])
```

* We will use a Python library called [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html)
* First we create an *undirected* graph, meaning it does not matter which direction we travel along the edges


---

### We only have nodes (vertices) 1,2,3 let's connect them with edges

```python
G.add_edge(1, 2, color='r',weight=2)

e = (2, 3) #another way to add an edge
G.add_edge(*e)  

G.add_nodes_from([4, 5]) #add two more vertices
G.add_edges_from([(3, 4), (3, 5)]) #add edges differently

nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, font_weight='bold') #labels used are node numbers 
```

---

### Let us add nodes with attributes

```python
G.add_node(6, molecule="protein") #now we also have vertex attribute
G.add_nodes_from([7,8,9], molecule="rna") #add a bunch of RNA vertices
G.nodes[1]["molecule"] = "protein"  #modify attributes of existing vertex
G.add_edges_from([(5,6),(5,7),(7,8),(8,9)])#connect these to the graph

labels = nx.get_node_attributes(G, 'molecule') #using custom labels for nodes
nx.draw(G, labels=labels, font_weight='bold') 

```

### Let's see this in Python code 

```python

G1 = nx.DiGraph() #now we have a directed graph
G1.add_edges_from([(1,2), (2,3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]) #this adds nodes and edges 

```
