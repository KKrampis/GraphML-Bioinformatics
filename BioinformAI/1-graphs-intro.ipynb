    "### Graph Theory and Network analysis in Bioinformatics\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this lecture we will discuss basic Graph and Network Theory concepts and data structures\n",
    "* Graphs or otherwise networks are one of the most common ways to represent bioinformatics data \n",
    "  * Interaction between genes and proteins (genetic regulation) can be represented as graphs\n",
    "  * Protein structures can also be respensented as graphs denoting the chemical connections between atoms\n",
    "  * Beyond molecular biology, interacting species for example can be represented as graphs in ecology\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the information we cover today can also be found in this [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_network) \n",

    "### What is a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "* A mathematical structure capturing binary relationships between objects called *nodes* or *vertices*\n",
    "* The binary relationships are represented by links or *edges* between the *vertices*\n",
    "* The *edges* can be of a specific type : *directed or undirected, weighted or not*\n",
    "* Both *nodes* and *edges* can have attributes attached to them\n",

    "\n",
    "* Protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) represent the physical relationship among proteins present in a cell\n",
    "* Proteins are nodes, and their interactions are undirected edges\n",
    "* Proteinâ€“protein interactions are essential to the cellular processes and well studied networks in biology\n",
    "* Proteins with high degrees of connectedness (nodes with many links) are more likely to be essential for survival of the cell\n",
